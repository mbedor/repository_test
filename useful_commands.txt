chmod
=======
The syntax of the chmod command when using the symbolic mode has the following format:
chmod [OPTIONS] [ugoa…][-+=]perms…[,…] FILE...
Copy
The first set of flags ([ugoa…]), users flags, defines which users classes the permissions to the file are changed.
u - The file owner.
g - The users who are members of the group.
o - All other users.
a - All users, identical to ugo.
If the users flag is omitted, the default one is a and the permissions that are set by umask are not affected.
The second set of flags ([-+=]), the operation flags, defines whether the permissions are to be removed, added, or set:
- Removes the specified permissions.
+ Adds specified permissions.
= Changes the current permissions to the specified permissions. If no permissions are specified after the = symbol, all permissions from the specified user class are removed.


4 stands for "read",
2 stands for "write",
1 stands for "execute", and
0 stands for "no permission."
